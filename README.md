                        ** Research Accomplishments in Computational Neuroscience and Machine Learning **
During my PhD, I specialized in computational neuroscience, focusing on chemical ischemia-induced changes in astrocyte function in the neocortex. I investigated the role of NMDA and AMPA receptors in neuronal activity-evoked changes in sodium concentration and calcium dynamics in astrocytes under metabolic stress conditions. Additionally, I analyzed the role of NBCe1 in pH regulation during ischemia using biophysical models and experimental validation. Utilizing Markov models, I developed detailed biophysical models to simulate ion changes, including sodium and calcium dynamics, and predict cellular responses during transient energy deprivation. My research also involved analyzing ATP consumption differences and Naa signaling heterogeneity between neocortical and hippocampal astrocytes under ischemic conditions. In the realm of machine learning, I applied techniques such as LSTM and SVM for EEG signal analysis and participated in the Kaggle competition dataset of HMS - Harmful Brain Activity Classification, showcasing my interdisciplinary skills in computational neuroscience and machine learning.

Looking ahead, I am enthusiastic about exploring the intersection of computational neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and healthcare innovation. My broader interests include neuroinformatics, brain-computer interfaces, translational research, and open-source collaborative initiatives. I am committed to leveraging my interdisciplinary background to develop computational tools, models, and solutions that can drive advancements in both neuroscience research and clinical applications.
