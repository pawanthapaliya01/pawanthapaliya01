During my PhD research, I specialized in computational neuroscience with a focus on chemical ischemia-induced changes in astrocyte function in the neocortex. My research primarily centered on the role of NMDA and AMPA receptors in neuronal activity-evoked changes in sodium concentration in astrocytes under metabolic stress conditions. I employed Markov models to develop detailed biophysical models that simulated ion changes, including sodium and calcium dynamics, and predicted cellular responses during transient energy deprivation. Additionally, I constructed a model specifically for pH measurement to understand acid-base balance during chemical ischemia in the neocortex. This involved extensive data analysis, where I interpreted complex datasets to discern Naa signaling heterogeneity and ATP consumption differences between neocortical and hippocampal astrocytes under ischemic conditions. I successfully validated these model predictions experimentally through fluorescence-based measurements and ion-selective microelectrode recordings. My work culminated in contributions to the publication of research findings, demonstrating my ability to disseminate research findings effectively. This experience honed my skills in mathematical modeling, particularly using Markov models, data interpretation, and experimental validation, providing me with a solid foundation in computational neuroscience and biomedical research focused on chemical ischemia and ion channel dynamics.
In addition to my modeling work, I possess strong machine learning and neural network skills, which I applied to analyze EEG signals using Fourier, wavelet, and empirical mode analysis techniques. I have experience implementing advanced machine learning algorithms, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Support Vector Machines (SVM), for EEG signal classification. This expertise was further demonstrated in my participation in the Kaggle competition dataset of HMS - Harmful Brain Activity Classification, where I successfully performed multiclass classification using these machine learning techniques. These experiences have enriched my skill set, combining computational neuroscience with machine learning approaches to address complex biomedical challenges effectively
